======

Here is the place to submit bug reports, features requests, etc for OresomeCraft.

If a bug poses a large risk to one of the OresomeCraft servers or services, please contact us privately at contact@oresomecraft.com

### Submission:

[here]:https://github.com/OresomeCraft/Issues/issues
Issues are reported using Github's built in Issue management. You can get to that by clicking [here].

### How to make a report:

#### Reports should be made under the following format:

**Description of the bug:** Be descriptive here. Does it occur while in game, in a specific map, only on certain weapons, how many people were on at the time? BE SPECIFIC!

**Steps to re-produce:** Tell us how we can re-produce the issue. If we can't produce the error ourselves, we likely won't be able to fix it.

**Screen shots:** This is not required, only supply them if necessary.

**Priority:** Be logical when answering this. If something is just down right breaking the game play then it would be a high priority. If it's just something like a typo, minor graphical glitch, etc it would be a low priority.
